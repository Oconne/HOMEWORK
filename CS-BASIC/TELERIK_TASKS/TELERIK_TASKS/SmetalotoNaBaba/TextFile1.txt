Problem 5 – Na Baba mi Smetalnika 
 
 
 
See this mad baba? She is crazy I tell you! But this is life and you are going to be stuck with her for all the 
lqto, so better pay attention! 
The baba has very izbuhliva personality, so every time you mess up something she smacks your head 
with her tochilka. She mainly spends her vreme in pletene of sweaters, which she sells to important 
klienti on the selski market. 
Every sweater has a different sharka, so she needs to calculate how many reda to use of one prejda and 
how many of some other kind. She figured out a formula that helps her to izchisli the right amount of 
rows and brimki. 
The formula is as follows: She uses a different smetalo for every sweater, and every smetalo has 
different number of topchenca. As she plete, she moves the topchenca to the left or right side of the 
smetaloto. If she makes a mistake she resets the smetaloto by placing all the topchenca on the left 
most side. 
Once she is done she izchislqva the sum of all the lines and then multiplies them by the broikata of all 
columns that don’t have any topchenca in them. 
Since you are spending the summer with her, she put you in charge of the smetaloto, but be 
vnimatelen, because if you opleskash the formula she will mess up the sweater and you will get 
smacked. Every time she smacks your head some mozuchni cells are dying and you lose a part of your 
genialnost. 
Quick! Use what mozuk you have left to create a computer program, that can do your rabota for you, 
before you get so tup that you cannot think straight from getting smacked on the head by this luda 
baba! 
How the smetalnika works: 
You need to know how wide it needs to be, so that it can calculate the sharkata for the current sweater. 
Listen to the babata, she will tell you the width at the beginning. After that she will give you 8 positive 
numbers that you have to magically preobrazuvash into bitwise data and use the bits as topchenca for 
your smetalnik. 
After this is done she will start giving you commands: Whenever she makes a mistake she will tell you to 
“reset” the smetaloto, so she can start over. Then you must burzo put all the topchenca to the left most

corner. When she tells you to slide “right” or “left”, this means that you need to put your prust on a 
selected line and position and to slide all the topchenca to the left or to the right most corner of the 
smetaloto. 
Once she is gotova she will tell you to “stop” and tell her the result. You better do it fast or that brain 
cells killing smack is coming right at you! 
Input 
The input data should be red from the console. 
On the first line you will be given the width of the smetaloto. 
On the next 8 lines you will be given 8 numbers, one number on each line, so you can use them to 
understand where to put your topchenca. 
After that you will receive a random number of commands - “reset”, “right” and “left”. If there is no 
topchence where she tells you to slide your finger, you must do it either way, since she is a little 
kiorava, and sometimes misses the right position. When you slide you must always start from where she 
instructs you and stop when you reach the opposite krai of the smetaloto. 
The program must end when the “stop” command is given. The result must be printed right afterwards. 
Output 
The output data should be printed on the console. 
The output result is the sum of all the lines as numbers multiplied by the number of columns that don’t 
have any topchenca in them. 
Constraints 
 The width of the smetaloto will be from 5 to 32 inclusive. 
 The eight numbers will be from 0 to 2 147 483 647 inclusive. 
 The line will be from 0 to 7 inclusive. 
 The prust position will be from -50 to 50 inclusive. 
 There will be no topchenca outside of the smetaloto at any given time. 
 Allowed work time for your program: 0.1 seconds. 
 Allowed memory: 16 MB.
